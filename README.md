- Personal Notes: <br>
This project was a really fun way for me to introduce myself to the basics of [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). More specifically,
I learned a lot about how to structure applications using React components, how those components interacted with one another, and how to utilize these tools for future
projects.
